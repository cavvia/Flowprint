Flowprint
=========

Visualise dynamics of spatial networks in Processing. Originally produced to deal with urban networks.

Feature Summary
---------------
* Import network representations in [NCOL][ncol] format, including weighted networks based on euclidean distances.
* Import node locations (lat/long or northing/easting).
* Visualise topology of spatial networks.
* Visualise node attributes.
* Visualise node labels.
* Import and construct network routes.
* Visualise flows of 'vessels' or 'passengers' on network routes.
* Import real trip information for playback of flows.
* Capture vector or video output.

Examples
--------
See the [London Bus Flowprint][flowprint] example.


How-To
------

*Coming Soon*

Dependencies
------------

You'll need the [Processing][processing] visualisation framework, as well as the [ControlP5][controlp5] and [gicentre-utils][spatial] libraries.
