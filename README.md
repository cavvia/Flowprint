Flowprint
=========

Visualise dynamics of spatial networks in Processing. Originally produced to deal with urban transport networks.

Feature Summary
---------------
* Import network representations in [NCOL][ncol] format, including weighted networks based on euclidean distances.
* Visualise topology of spatial networks.
* Visualise node attributes.
* Visualise labelled networks.
* Visualise flows of 'vessels' or 'passengers' on network.
* Import real trip information for playback of flows.

Examples
--------
See the [London Bus Flowprint][flowprint] example.


How-To
------

*Coming Soon*

Dependencies
------------

You'll need the [Processing][processing] visualisation framework. As well as the [ControlP5][controlp5] and [gicentre-utils][spatial] libraries.
